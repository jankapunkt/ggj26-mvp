# ggj26-mvp - Tetris Clone

Building a throw-away prototype for GGJ26 - A minimal Tetris clone for learning Godot game development.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Godot Engine 4.3 or later (download from https://godotengine.org/download/)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ggj26-mvp
   ```

2. **Open the project in Godot:**
   - Launch Godot Engine
   - Click "Import" on the project manager
   - Navigate to the project folder and select `project.godot`
   - Click "Import & Edit"

3. **Run the game:**
   - Press F5 or click the "Play" button in the top-right corner
   - The game will start immediately

## How to Play

### Controls
- **← / A**: Move piece left
- **→ / D**: Move piece right
- **↓ / S**: Move piece down faster (soft drop)
- **↑ / W / Space**: Rotate piece clockwise
- **Shift** (hold): Slow down falling speed
- **Enter**: Hard drop (instant drop to bottom)
- **Enter** (when game over): Restart game
- **Escape**: Pause Game

### Objective
- Stack falling tetromino pieces to create complete horizontal lines
- Complete lines are cleared and you earn points
- Game ends when pieces stack to the top of the board

### Scoring
- 1 line: 40 points
- 2 lines: 100 points
- 3 lines: 300 points
- 4 lines (Tetris): 1200 points

## Development Notes

### Core Components

#### tetris_game.gd
The main game controller that handles:
- Game board state (10x20 grid)
- 7 tetromino shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L)
- Piece movement, rotation, and collision detection
- Line clearing and scoring
- Game over detection

Key functions:
- `spawn_piece()`: Creates a new random tetromino
- `move_piece()`: Handles piece movement with collision detection
- `rotate_piece()`: Rotates pieces with wall kick support
- `clear_lines()`: Detects and removes complete lines
- `_draw()`: Custom rendering of the game board

#### ui_controller.gd
Manages the user interface:
- Score display
- Game over message
- Control instructions

### Godot Features Used

This project demonstrates several Godot concepts:
- **Node2D**: Base class for 2D game objects
- **Custom drawing**: Using `_draw()` for rendering the game board
- **Input handling**: Processing keyboard input with Input actions
- **Timer logic**: Implementing automatic piece falling
- **CanvasLayer**: UI overlay system
- **Scene structure**: Organizing game components

### For Collaborative Development

When working on this project:
1. Keep the Godot project files in version control
2. The `.godot/` folder is gitignored (auto-generated by Godot)
3. Scene files (.tscn) are text-based and merge-friendly
4. Scripts use GDScript with documentation comments
5. All game logic is well-commented for learning purposes

### Extending the Game

Ideas for improvements:
- Add a "next piece" preview
- Implement a hold piece feature
- Add levels with increasing speed
- Include sound effects and music
- Add particle effects for line clears
- Implement a high score system
- Add different game modes (e.g., timed, marathon)
