# Masquerade
Our GGJ26 Game Project.



## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Godot Engine 4.3 or later (download from https://godotengine.org/download/)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ggj26-mvp
   ```

2. **Open the main project in Godot:**
   - Launch Godot Engine
   - Click "Import" on the project manager
   - Navigate to the project folder and select `project.godot` (at root level)
   - Click "Import & Edit"

3. **Run the game:**
   - Press F5 or click the "Play" button in the top-right corner
   - The game will start immediately

### Tetris Prototype

The Tetris prototype is located in the `tetris/` folder:
- To play Tetris, open `tetris/project.godot` in Godot

## Masquerade - Vertical Chase Game

A vertical scrolling game where you avoid enemies while being chased by an entity.

### Controls
- **A / D or Arrow Keys**: Move left/right
- **1-4**: Switch between abilities
- **Enter**: Restart (when game over)
- **Pause**: Pause and Resume Game

### Game Features

- **9:16 Portrait viewport** (540x960)
- **Player positioned in upper third** of screen
- **Shadow** that follows the player
- **Infinite scrolling** - background moves upward creating downward movement illusion
- **Random enemy spawning** with decreasing intervals
- **Collision detection** - touching shadow triggers game over
- **4 Abilities** - player can switch between them
- **Game over screen** with "Game Over" message

See [GAME_README.md](GAME_README.md) for detailed documentation.

## Development Notes

### Main Game Components

#### game.gd
The main game controller that handles:
- Infinite scrolling background effect
- Enemy spawning with decreasing intervals
- Collision detection between player and enemies
- Game state management (running/game over)
- Ability switching system (1-5 keys)

#### player.gd
Player controller:
- Horizontal movement (A/D or arrow keys)
- Boundary constraints to keep player on screen
- Collision shape for enemy detection

#### chaser.gd
Chase entity that:
- Follows player with smooth interpolation
- Renders as elliptic shape
- Creates pressure on player

#### enemy.gd
Enemy behavior:
- Three visual types with different shapes
- Moves upward to simulate downward scrolling
- Destroys itself when off-screen
- Signals when destroyed for spawn management

### Tetris Prototype Components

The `tetris/` folder contains a complete Tetris implementation (see tetris/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md).

### Godot Features Used

This project demonstrates:
- **Node2D**: Base class for 2D game objects
- **CharacterBody2D**: Physics-based player movement
- **Area2D**: Collision detection for enemies
- **Custom drawing**: Using `_draw()` for rendering shapes
- **Input handling**: Processing keyboard input
- **Timer logic**: Enemy spawning intervals
- **CanvasLayer**: UI overlay system
- **Signals**: Communication between nodes
- **Scene instancing**: Dynamic enemy spawning

### For Collaborative Development

When working on this project:
1. Keep the Godot project files in version control
2. The `.godot/` folder is gitignored (auto-generated by Godot)
3. Scene files (.tscn) are text-based and merge-friendly
4. Scripts use GDScript with clear commenting
5. Main game is at root level, Tetris prototype in `tetris/` folder

### Extending the Main Game

Ideas for improvements:
- Implement specific functions for the 5 abilities
- Add scoring system based on survival time
- Add visual effects for enemy destruction
- Include sound effects and music
- Add particle effects
- Implement difficulty curves
- Add power-ups or collectibles
- Add high score system
- Add different game modes
